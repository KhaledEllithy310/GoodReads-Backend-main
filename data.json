  "decribtion":"In the early days of the Civil War, rumors of gold in the frozen Klondike brought hordes of newcomers to the Pacific 
                Northwest. Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine 
               through Alaska’s ice. Thus was Dr. Blue’s Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.
               But on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing 
               a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.
               Now it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives 
                Blue’s widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. 
                Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history."

  The Agony House, and the Philip K. Dick Award nominee Maplecroft; but she is perhaps best known for the steampunk pulp
  adventures of the Clockwork Century, beginning with Boneshaker. Her works have been nominated for the Hugo and Nebula awards
  for science fiction, and have won the Locus Award (among others) – and over the years, they’ve been translated into nine languages
in eleven countries. Cherie lives in Seattle, WA, with her husband and a menagerie of exceedingly photogenic pets."
